Fraud Detection Approaches

So companies start to detect these fraud activities automatically by using smart technologies. 

First, companies hire few people only for the detection of these kinds of activities or transactions. But here they must and should be experts in this field or domain, and also the team should have knowledge of how frauds occur in particular domains. This requires more resources, such as people's effort and time.

Second, companies changed manual processes to rule-based solutions. But this one also fails most of the time to detect frauds. 

Because in the real world, the way of doing frauds is changing drastically day by day. These rule-based systems follow some rules and conditions. If a new fraud process is different from others, then these systems fail. It requires adding that new rule to code and execute. 

Now companies are trying to adopt Artificial Intelligence or machine learning algorithms to detect frauds. Machine learning algorithms performed very well for this type of problem. 

What is Credit Card Fraud Detection?

It uses the combination of fraud and non-fraud transactions from the historical data with different people's credit card transaction data to estimate fraud or non-fraud on credit card transactions.

Understanding of Credit Card Dataset 

For this credit card fraud classification problem, we are using the dataset which was downloaded from the Kaggle platform. 

Such as 

What is the size of the dataset?
How many features does the dataset have?
What are the target values?
How many samples under each target value? , etc.
